<h1>About me</h1>
<img src="img/pic3.jpg">
<h2>My name is Mawuli Ayikpa</h2>
<p>I am from Ghana and my wife Janet and I are expecting our first child. I love cooking Ghanaian
  food a lot.I am pursuing web and software development.
  <p>Unfortunately I'm not a member of the Churh of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but I love
  everything about the Church, especially the church want everybody to be educated or have a skill 
  that would be a benefit for him and family. This course will help me in my enterpreneur journey 
  because I can create my own web-based products or services by reducing development cost. I'm
  excited to be in this class.
